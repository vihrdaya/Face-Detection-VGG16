# Face-Detection-VGG16
Using the VGG16 CNN to model face detection

## Introduction

I am training the VGG16 CNN model to detects and classify pictures of faces. This is an update of an earlier project I made in 2020 where I used a haar cascade to find faces in an image and used a gaussian blur to blur the faces. I wanted to use something a tad more complicated and newer to try facial detection. My original intention was to create my own cascades, but after some reaserch I found out that cascades were becoming obsolete. Thus, I arrived at CNNs. Although I am only at the edge the field, I am very fascinated at the power and efficiency of the models. I've been experimenting non-stop with snippets of code I almost forgot to actually work on a full project. I can't wait to see how far I can push these models.
